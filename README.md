 CodeLouisville Project - Travel budgeting app 
Base code of the app is from @CodeExplained

The main goal of this coding project is to help users as they plan trips. This trip budget app allows users to input the costs (expenses)of their trip and deposits they have made to savings. Users can use this to calculate costs and to track their contributions to the trip to stay on budget. This is a tool with the goal in mind to be used as a quick reference of a user's budget and travel costs.

Project Features
1. Create a form and save the values (on click of Submit button) to an external file 
You must show us or document where that information is being stored so we can confirm that itâ€™s being saved/persisted
* User can input their expenses and savings with titles and amounts that will be added to the dashboard. The user data will be saved on local storage

2. Create an array, dictionary, or list, populate it with multiple values, retrieve at least one value, and use or display it in your application
* The entry of expenses and savings will be visible as a list. Users can edit and delete items on the savings, expenses, or all dashboard tabs.

3. Create and use a function that accepts two or more values (parameters), calculates or determines a new value based on those inputs, and returns a new value
*Expenses and savings are calculated into the budget which is shown to the user.

4. Visualize data in a graph, chart, or other visual representation of data
* There is a chart element that is visible to users as they enter expenses and savings. The chart will show expenses percentage in red and savings in white.
